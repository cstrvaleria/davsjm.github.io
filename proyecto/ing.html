    <p>This research analyzes and explores the issue of rainwater, which is an issue
        we don't give due importance, affecting areas such as the social and ecomomic.
        We want to give it importance because we believe everyone should start learning
        more about this hydric resource, since it is efficient not only for the community
        but also for the environment.
    </p>
    <p>We will talk about how history allows us to know about our present on the subject
        of this resource, explaining some of the main environmental laws, apart of the structural
        reforms in the last decade, as well as the institutions involved in the issue of water
        care. Also making known more about this resource, what it is, its importance, characteristics
        properties, etc. Offering like this, ideas to implement this practice in our daily life,
        and community's as well, also, taking into account the fundamental concepts of physics, we
        make a proposal which would help us to collect rainwater and reuse it in daily life activities,
        also putting it to the test with a graphic representation in a prototype mady by our team.
    </p>
    <p>The type of investigation will be focused on conclusions and mainly according to our research,
        being documentary amd field with a qualitative and quantitative study. To detail, a data collection
        was carried out to develop our project via an statidistical graph and different graphic organizers
        and, therefore, facilitating a better understanding.
    </p>
    <p>This project tends to understand and give knowledge to our community about this hydric resource,
        wanting to give an updated importance to its standarts, pointing out the proposed objectives.
